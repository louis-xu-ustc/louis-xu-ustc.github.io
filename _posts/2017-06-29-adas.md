title: "A Surround View and Moving Object Detector System"
---

This project was carried out in Prof. [**Ragunathan "Raj" Rajkumar**](https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~raj/)'s Lab.
The objective is to build the Advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) using TI TDX2x and Nvidia TX1/2 platform.

> Moving object detector - Nvidia TX1 platform

- Implement moving object detection with mono fisheye camera on Nvidia TX1/TX2 platform
- Evaluate the performance of OpenCV application and use CUDA OpenCV to optimize the application

> Surround view monitoring - TI TDA2x platform

- Port and integrate surround view monitoring application with 4 fisheye cameras to TI TDX2x platform
- Optimize the ported application using DSP, GPU and vision accelerator supported by the system
- Use prototype to test the built system, and then deploy the system to real car for further evaluation
