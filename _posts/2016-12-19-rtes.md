title: "Resource Reservation and Energy Management Framework in Linux Kernel" 
---

A Linux kernel framework that involves Linux scheduler, timers, signals, system calls, sysfs interface and Android applications
to reserve applications based on timing, cpu, and power constraints.

**Part 1: Process Budget Accounting and Instrumentation**  
In real-time systems, it's critical to guarantee that thread will never exceed its allowed compute time. However, threads
are not that obedient in practice and may overrun their budget due to inference from non-realtime best effort tasks or an 
inaccurately estimated worst case execution time.  
To maintain the safety of the system, we implement a resource reservation framework in the kernel that will keep track 
of and enforce the thread budgets. 
In this part, the main features includes periodic test applications, reserve management syscalls, kernel instrumentation
for task utilization measurement, and task monitor android application.

***Figure 1.** utilization data display*  

**Figure 1** consists of two tasks onto which reserves with periods T0 = 10 ms and T1 = 8 ms respectively were set. 
Reserve on Task 0 was set before monitoring began. Task 0 does the same amount of computation (2.5 ms) each period: U0 = 2.5/10 = 0.25. 
Reserve on Task 1 was set while the monitoring was in progress. The utilization of Task 1 varied from 0.5 in its ﬁrst 
recorded period to 0.75 in its second period and to 0.625 in its remaining two periods.

**Part 2: Reservation Enforcement and Guarantee**  
In part 1, we associated a reservation with a thread and accounted the computation time it consumed. However, when a thread
exceeded its budget the most our kernel did was to notify the offender with a harmless signal. In this part, we endow the 
reservation framework with the ultimate power of suspending and resuming threads so that a thread can only run while its budget lasts.  
In this part, the detailed features includes reservation enforcement, reservation guarantees (reservation status, admission test on one
processor, admission test on many processors).  
In the admission test on many processors part, we implemented the following bin-packing heuristics for assigning tasks to processors.
- First-Fit
- Next-Fit
- Best-Fit
- Worst-Fit  

The “bins” are the physical processors that exist on the platform.

**Part 3: Energy Management**  
In the previous parts, we focused on the resource reservation framework, and in this part we switched to energy management for Linux tasks.
The detailed features includes kernel support for energy tracking, energy monitor native application, energy-efficient task partitioning, and
energy-efficient sleep scheduling. 
Also, we did the energy comparision experiment for different energy management algorithms like WFD, BFD, LST, ES-RHS+.

***Figure 2.** energy consumption comparision experiment* 

**Figure 2** shows the average energy consumption’s change when total task set utilization increases from 0.36 to 0.86.
We can conclude that the energy saving effect of LST and ES-RHS+ are more efficient compared to WFD and BFD. 
This phenomenon is consistent with the explanation that “A corollary of a balanced load is that the load on each service 
provider is at the minimum. The latter property is particularly useful for energy-efficient task partitioning. 
Energy of a processor is determined by its frequency, which is constrained by the load allocated to the processor. 
The list policy can be naturally adapted into a bin packing or real-time task partitioning policy: assign a task to the 
core with the smallest load so far. The cores that currently have no tasks assigned to them have zero load and always 
participate as candidate bins. This differs from Worst-Fit-Decreasing policy which opens a new bin only when the current 
bins cannot accommodate the object. Since the list policy minimizes the load and hence the frequency on individual processors, 
it should save energy.”

***Figure 3.** energy simulation using Python*  

We also write a python program to simulate the energy consumption comparison experiment as shwon in **Figure 3**.
We generate 35 tasks for every policy (5 tasks as a taskset) and control the average utility of those taskset in an ascending order.
From the phote above, the energy consumption of WF and BF are similar, and LST and ES-RHS+ are similar. But, ES-RHS+ fluctuate more heavily than LST.
