title: "A Reconfiguration Framework for ROS (Robot Operating System) running on TurtleBot"
---

A reconfiguration framework that allows users (ROS application developers) to swap navigation and control algorithms
and parameters being used in the robot at runtime. Also, practiced Spiral and Scrum software development process and 
quality assurance in the software development life cycle.

#### Where the project come from ?
The idea of this project stems from the development of CoBot robots, by some faculty and students in the CMU Robotics department.
These robots have been used to pursue academic research in effective real-time mobile robot localization and navigation algorithms, symbiotic human-robot interaction, and multi-task multi-robot dynamic task planning. 
These robots are highly stable and have recorded over 1000 km of travel distance, but are not easily maintainable and modifiable, especially in terms of runtime reconfigurability.

#### What features the framework provide ?
- Be responsible for managing the interactions between multiple nodes on a bot when configuring/reconfiguring (adding, removing, switching on, switching off nodes) happens. 
- Ensures the stability of the bot (and the state of the nodes) during and after the respective configuration/reconfiguration activity.
- Fault management mechanism is provided to detect and mitigate faults or issues that occur during the reconfiguration scenarios.

#### What I have done ?
- Act as the architect of the team to design software architecture of the reconfiguration framework for ROS (Robot Operating System).
- Abstract actions of the framework and create the model to verify LTL property, implement PROMELA (Process or Protocol Meta Language) code to verity the system. 
- For the first framework design using static registration, implement 100% of the framework include node dependency registration, use case to test the framework 
- For the second framework design using ROS wrappers APIs, implement more than 80% of the framework, including node dependency, original ROS APIs wrapper, 
use test to verify our framework
