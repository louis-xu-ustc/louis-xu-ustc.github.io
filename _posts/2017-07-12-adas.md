title: "A Surround View and Moving Object Detector System"
---

This project was carried out in CyLab, Carnegie Mellon University and advised by Prof. [**Ragunathan "Raj" Rajkumar**](https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~raj/).
The final objective is to build an Advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) using TI TDX2x and Nvidia TX1 platform.  
As Figure 1 shows the system will be able to show the moving object detection (MOD) and surround view using a vehicle.

***Figure 2.** Overview of the system objective*

### Moving object detector - Nvidia TX1 platform

- Implemented moving object detection with mono fisheye camera on Nvidia TX1/TX2 platform
- Evaluated the performance of OpenCV application and applied CUDA OpenCV to optimize the application
- Improved each frame's processing time by 23.5% after optimization using CUDA

### Surround view monitoring - TI TDA2x platform

- Ported and integrate surround view monitoring application with 4 fisheye cameras to TI TDX2x platform
- Optimized the ported application using DSP, GPU and vision accelerator supported by the system
- Applied prototype to test the built system, and then deploy the system to real car for further evaluation

### Surround View Calibration and System Test

We also verified the system we built using real-time recorded videos and evaluated the system performance.
