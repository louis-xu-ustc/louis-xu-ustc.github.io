title: "A Surround View and Moving Object Detector System"
---

This project was carried out in CyLab, Carnegie Mellon University and advised by Prof. [**Ragunathan "Raj" Rajkumar**](https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~raj/).
The final objective is to build a system that can show the surround view of a vehicle and also detects moving objects 
based on the four fish-eye cameras on TI TDX2x and Nvidia TX1 platform.   

### Moving object detector - Nvidia TX1 platform

#### My role

- Implemented moving object detection with mono fisheye camera on Nvidia TX1 platform
- Evaluated the performance of OpenCV application and applied CUDA OpenCV to optimize the application
- Improved each frame's processing time by 23.5% after optimization using CUDA

#### Details

### Surround view monitoring - TI TDA2x platform

#### My role
- Ported the MOD algorithm to TI TDA2x and help bring up surround view monitoring system with TI platform 
- Applied prototype to test the built system, and then deploy the system to real car for further evaluation
- Do calibration based on the positions of vehicle and mounted cameras and live demo the whole system

#### Calibration

We also verified the system we built using real-time recorded videos and evaluated the system performance.
