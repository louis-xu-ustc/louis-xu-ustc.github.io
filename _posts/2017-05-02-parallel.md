title: "Parallel Galaxy Simulation"
---

[**A galaxy evolution simulator**](https://louis-xu-ustc.github.io/Parallel-Galaxy-Evolution-Simulator/) uses CUDA to 
speedup and implement different algorithms on the NVIDIA GPUs. The goal is to compare and analyze the speedup performance of these algorithms.
